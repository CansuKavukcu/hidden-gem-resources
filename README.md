# Undiscovered-gemsüßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


Hi all, 

My name is Cansu Kavukcu, and I am 32 years old. I am happily married and have been residing in the Netherlands for the past five years.

Now, I'd like to share a bit about my professional journey. I spent four years working in Turkey before relocating to the Netherlands, where I've been serving as a Technical Sourcer for the past two years. My experience spans across various sectors, including start-ups, enterprises, global banks, and a recruitment agency, primarily focusing on sourcing IT candidates. While I've been involved in different aspects of recruitment processes such as onboarding, crafting job descriptions, offering, and employer branding, my expertise lies in sourcing.

Joining a successful and dynamic team is a privilege for me. In my free time, I engage in a variety of activities, particularly enjoying exercise, cooking, and exploring new destinations. During the recent pandemic, I developed an interest in programming and embarked on creating my own resume parser robot using Python. Additionally, I've begun taking Dutch courses to further integrate into the community and accelerate my learning process with the support of colleagues.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to getting acquainted with you, and I'm ready to address any questions you may have.
