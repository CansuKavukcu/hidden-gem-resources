Hi all, 

Let me introduce myself ;
My name is Cansu Kavukcu and I‚Äôm 28 years old. I am married and I have been living in the NL for 2,5 years. 
And now I would be pleased to share few facts about my professional background. I had worked for 4 years in Turkey and I have been working for 2 years in the Netherlands as a Technical Sourcer. I have worked in various types of companies like start-ups, enterprises, global banks, and a recruitment agency for sourcing IT candidates. Apart from this, I also took roles in recruitment processes like onboarding, preparing job description, offering and employer branding but sourcing is the part that I have most experience in.  

The idea of becoming a part of a successful and productive team is an honour for me. In my spare time I undertake a wide range of activities; I‚Äôm particularly keen on doing exercise, cooking, and travelling. Recently, I developed interest in programming and I started writing my own resume parser robot with Python thanks to pandemic situationüòä. Additionally, I am starting taking Dutch courses and I believe, working together will help me a lot to speed up my learning processüòä. 

Thank you for your attention. I would be glad to get to know you and now I would be pleased to answer your questions!
